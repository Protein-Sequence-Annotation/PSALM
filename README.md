**NOTE**: We are currently in the process of significantly revamping PSALM into PSALM-2. This repository will always contain the most up-to-date version of PSALM (now PSALM-2). You can find the original PSALM code corresponding to the [2024 preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.04.596712v2) in this [repository](https://github.com/Protein-Sequence-Annotation/PSALM).
